To Download click the big green "Code" button on the top right corner of the GitHub repo, and download a .zip file containing all the contents.

The .html file is the ideal file for reading and learning. There's a lot of text in this file, and R code is contained in grey "chunks". Often these chunks are followed by the output produced by running the code. You can copy and paste code from they grey chunks into your RStudio console to run bits of code.

The .Rmd file is the file used to create the .html file. It's less readable than the .html, but you can run the chunks of code using the play button at the top of each chunk within RStudio. Or, you can open the .Rmd in RStudio and copy and paste lines of code into the console. You will not be able to "knit" this .Rmd file and produce your own .html, as I have not included the images the files requires in this repo.

The .R file is auto-created from the .Rmd file by stripping all the text and leaving the lines of R code contained in the .Rmd chunks. This is ideal, as you can run each line sequentially by using CTRL+ENTER (Windows) or CMD+RETURN (Mac). However, there's a lot of messy comments included that come from the .Rmd file.
